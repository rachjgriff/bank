![bank_irb_example](images/bank_irb_example_update_2.png)

## REQUIREMENTS
---------
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
---------
* **Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012
* **And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012
* **And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012
* **When** she prints her bank statement
* **Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

## APPROACH & STRATEGY
---------
* Class BankAccount
  * Initialize with:
    * @balance = 0
    * @transactions_history = []
* Methods:
  * deposit(date: , credit: )
  * withdrawal(date: , debit: )
  * record_transaction
  * bank_statement
* Actions:
  * Update balance
  * Store all transactions
  * Print transactions in above format and in reverse chronological order
* Assumptions:
  * Date, credit & debit are entered
  * Date is a string

##### QUESTIONS/THOUGHTS
* Can the client make more than one deposit or withdrawal a day?
  * If so, should the credit and debit amounts sum these for that day?
  * Or can there be more than one entry for the same date?
* Should the date auto-generate rather than get added manually as a string?
